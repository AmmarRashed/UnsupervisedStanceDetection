# Embedding-based Unsupervised User Stance Detection
- Source code for: [Embeddings-Based Clustering for Target Specific Stances: The Case of a Polarized Turkey
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09649)
- We propose an unsupervised user stance detection method to capture fine grained divergences in a community across various topics. We employ pre-trained universal sentence encoders to represent users based on the content of their tweets on a particular topic. User vectors are projected into a lower dimensional space using UMAP, then clustered using HDBSCAN.
- Our method is able to capture stances to the party-affiliation level in a completely unsupervised manner.
